Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.


Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment
Step 1: Select Your Operating System (OS)
Download and Install Windows 11
Go to Windows 11 Download Page.
Follow the instructions to download the Windows 11 installation media.
Create a bootable USB or use the Windows Installation Assistant to upgrade your current OS.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
Step 2: Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Download and Install Visual Studio Code
Go to Visual Studio Code Download Page.
Select the version compatible with your OS and download the installer.
Run the installer and follow the setup instructions.
Launch Visual Studio Code after installation is complete.
Step 3: Set Up Version Control System
Install Git
Go to Git Download Page.
Download the appropriate installer for your OS.
Run the installer and follow the setup instructions, making sure to select the options to integrate Git with your command line and install Git Bash.
Configure Git
Open Git Bash and set your username and email:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
Create a GitHub Account
Go to GitHub and sign up for a new account.
Verify your email and set up your profile.
Initialize a Git Repository
Create a new project folder on your local machine:
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
git init
Create a README file and make your first commit:
echo "# My Project" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Push to GitHub
Create a new repository on GitHub and follow the instructions to push your local repository to GitHub:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my_project.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Step 4: Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes
Install Python
Go to Python Download Page.
Download the latest version for Windows.
Run the installer and ensure you check the option to "Add Python to PATH".
Verify the installation by opening Command Prompt and typing:
python --version
Step 5: Install Package Managers
Install pip
Pip is included with Python 3.4 and later. Verify pip installation:
pip --version
Step 6: Configure a Database (MySQL)
Download and Install MySQL
Go to MySQL Installer Download Page.
Download the installer and run it.
Follow the setup instructions to install the MySQL server and MySQL Workbench.
Configure your MySQL server instance and create a new database.
Step 7: Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional)
Consider using Docker
Go to Docker Download Page.
Download Docker Desktop for Windows.
Run the installer and follow the setup instructions.
Verify the installation by running:
docker --version
Step 8: Explore Extensions and Plugins
Install Extensions in Visual Studio Code
Open Visual Studio Code.
Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.
Search for and install extensions such as:
Python (for Python development)
GitLens (for enhanced Git capabilities)
Prettier (for code formatting)
ESLint (for linting JavaScript)
